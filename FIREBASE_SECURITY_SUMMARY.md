# Firebase Security Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Firebase security implementation for the Masky application, including both Firestore and Storage security rules.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Firebase Authentication**: All operations require valid user authentication
- **JWT Token Verification**: API endpoints verify Firebase ID tokens
- **User Ownership**: Strict ownership verification for all data access

### 2. Data Isolation
- **Complete User Isolation**: Users can only access their own data
- **Project Ownership**: Users can only access projects they own
- **Alert Isolation**: Users can only access alerts for their own projects

## Firestore Security Rules

### User Data Protection
```javascript
// Users can only access their own user documents
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

### Project Data Protection
```javascript
// Users can only access projects they own
match /projects/{projectId} {
  allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && 
    resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() && 
    request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

### Alert Data Protection
```javascript
// Users can only access alerts for their own projects
match /projects/{projectId}/alerts/{alertId} {
  allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && 
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/projects/$(projectId)).data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

## Storage Security Rules

### File Upload Security
```javascript
// Voice files - users can only access their own
match /voices/{userId}_{fileName} {
  allow read, write: if isOwner(userId);
}

// Avatar images - users can only access their own
match /avatars/{userId}_{fileName} {
  allow read, write: if isOwner(userId);
}
```

## Real-time Security

### Twitch Event Display (`twitchevent.html`)
The real-time alert display page now includes:

#### Authentication Required
```javascript
// Wait for user authentication before accessing data
function waitForAuth() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
      unsubscribe();
      if (user) {
        currentUser = user;
        resolve(user);
      } else {
        reject(new Error('User not authenticated'));
      }
    });
  });
}
```

#### Project Ownership Verification
```javascript
// Verify user owns this project before loading
if (projectData.userId !== currentUser.uid) {
  throw new Error('Access denied - you do not own this project');
}
```

#### Real-time Listener Security
The real-time listener for alerts is protected by Firestore rules:
```javascript
// This listener is automatically protected by Firestore rules
const alertsRef = collection(db, 'projects', projectId, 'alerts');
const q = query(alertsRef, orderBy('timestamp', 'desc'), limit(1));
onSnapshot(q, (snapshot) => { ... });
```

## API Security Enhancements

### Project Ownership Validation
```javascript
// Enhanced saveProject function with ownership verification
if (projectId) {
  const existingProject = await db.collection('projects').doc(projectId).get();
  if (existingProject.data().userId !== userId) {
    return { statusCode: 403, body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Access denied' }) };
  }
}
```

### Recent Projects Security
```javascript
// Verify user owns each project before returning
if (projectData.userId === userId) {
  projects.push(projectData);
}
```

## Security Features

### ‚úÖ Complete Data Isolation
- Users cannot access other users' projects
- Users cannot access other users' alerts
- Users cannot access other users' files

### ‚úÖ Authentication Required
- All operations require Firebase authentication
- Unauthenticated requests are rejected
- Invalid tokens are rejected

### ‚úÖ Ownership Verification
- Project ownership verified on all operations
- File ownership verified for uploads
- Alert ownership verified for real-time access

### ‚úÖ Real-time Security
- Real-time listeners are protected by Firestore rules
- Users can only listen to their own project alerts
- No unauthorized real-time access possible

## Deployment

### Deploy Security Rules
```bash
# Linux/Mac
chmod +x deploy-rules.sh
./deploy-rules.sh

# Windows
deploy-rules.bat
```

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Deploy Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy Storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage
```

## Security Testing

### 1. Test User Isolation
- [ ] Create multiple user accounts
- [ ] Verify users cannot access each other's projects
- [ ] Test that alerts are properly isolated
- [ ] Verify file upload restrictions

### 2. Test Authentication
- [ ] Verify unauthenticated requests are rejected
- [ ] Test with invalid/expired tokens
- [ ] Verify proper error messages
- [ ] Test real-time listener authentication

### 3. Test Authorization
- [ ] Test project ownership verification
- [ ] Verify users cannot modify other users' projects
- [ ] Test file upload restrictions
- [ ] Test real-time alert access

### 4. Test Real-time Security
- [ ] Verify users can only listen to their own alerts
- [ ] Test that unauthorized users cannot access project data
- [ ] Verify alert isolation between users

## Security Benefits

### üîí Complete Data Isolation
- Users can only access their own data
- No cross-user data access possible
- Complete privacy protection

### üõ°Ô∏è Authentication Required
- All operations require valid authentication
- Unauthenticated access is impossible
- Secure token-based authentication

### ‚úÖ Ownership Verified
- Strict ownership checks on all operations
- Project ownership verified before access
- File ownership verified for uploads

### üö´ No Unauthorized Access
- All other access is explicitly denied

## Conclusion

The Firebase security implementation provides comprehensive protection for user data with:

- **Complete data isolation** between users
- **Authentication required** for all operations
- **Ownership verification** for all data access
- **Real-time security** for live alert displays
- **File security** for uploaded content
- **API security** with proper validation

The application is now properly secured with defense-in-depth security measures that ensure users can only access their own projects and data.
