# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Masky application to protect user data and ensure proper access control.

## Firebase Security Rules

### Firestore Rules (`firestore.rules`)

#### User Data Protection
- **Users Collection**: Users can only read/write their own user documents
- **Authentication Required**: All operations require user authentication
- **Owner Verification**: Strict ownership checks using `request.auth.uid`

#### Project Data Protection
- **Projects Collection**: Users can only access projects they own
- **Create Protection**: Users can only create projects with themselves as the owner
- **Read/Write Protection**: Users can only modify projects they own

#### Alert Data Protection
- **Alerts Subcollection**: Users can only access alerts for their own projects
- **Parent Project Verification**: Access is verified against the parent project's ownership
- **Real-time Security**: Real-time listeners are also protected by these rules

### Storage Rules (`storage.rules`)

#### File Upload Security
- **Voice Files**: Users can only upload/access their own voice recordings
- **Avatar Images**: Users can only upload/access their own avatar images
- **Project Files**: Users can only access files for projects they own
- **File Naming Convention**: Files are named with user ID to prevent conflicts

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication
- All API endpoints require Firebase authentication
- JWT tokens are verified on every request
- User sessions are managed by Firebase Auth

### 2. Authorization
- **Project Ownership**: Users can only access their own projects
- **Data Isolation**: Complete data isolation between users
- **API Protection**: All API endpoints verify user ownership

### 3. Data Validation
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **Type Checking**: Strict type checking on all data
- **Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized before storage

### 4. API Security
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are protected against abuse
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak information

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login to Firebase: `firebase login`
3. Initialize Firebase project: `firebase init`

### Deploy Security Rules

#### Option 1: Using the deployment script
```bash
# Linux/Mac
chmod +x deploy-rules.sh
./deploy-rules.sh

# Windows
deploy-rules.bat
```

#### Option 2: Manual deployment
```bash
# Deploy Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy Storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage
```

## Security Testing

### 1. Test User Isolation
- Create multiple user accounts
- Verify users cannot access each other's projects
- Test that alerts are properly isolated

### 2. Test Authentication
- Verify unauthenticated requests are rejected
- Test with invalid/expired tokens
- Verify proper error messages

### 3. Test Authorization
- Test project ownership verification
- Verify users cannot modify other users' projects
- Test file upload restrictions

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Regular Security Audits
- Review security rules quarterly
- Test for new vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies regularly

### 2. Monitoring
- Monitor Firebase usage for unusual patterns
- Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- Track API usage and errors

### 3. Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures

## Incident Response

### 1. Security Breach
- Immediately revoke compromised tokens
- Review access logs
- Update security rules if needed
- Notify affected users

### 2. Data Leak
- Identify the scope of the leak
- Implement additional security measures
- Review and update security rules
- Document lessons learned

## Compliance

### 1. Data Privacy
- User data is only accessible by the user
- No data sharing between users
- Proper data retention policies

### 2. GDPR Compliance
- Users can request data deletion
- Data portability is supported
- Clear privacy policies
