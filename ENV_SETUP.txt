# Quick Start: Environment Setup

1. CREATE .env FILE IN PROJECT ROOT
   Copy this and replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID with your actual Twitch Client ID:

   VITE_TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID

2. GET YOUR TWITCH CLIENT ID
   - Go to: https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps
   - Copy your Client ID
   - Paste it in the .env file above

3. SET REDIRECT URI IN TWITCH CONSOLE
   Add this redirect URI to your Twitch app:
   - Production: https://masky.net/auth/callback
   - Local: http://localhost:5173/auth/callback

4. DEPLOY BACKEND
   Run: serverless deploy --stage production

5. BUILD & DEPLOY FRONTEND

That's it! Your Twitch OAuth should now work.
